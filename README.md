# MaeCMS-Loader
place MaeCMS-Loader.php in the root folder, where you want to install Mae CMS and open it with your browser.
The loader will first check system requirements and then download and unpack the zip archive with the latest Mae CMS version.
Afterwards you will be provided with a link to the install script where you can define database connection and so on.
